**I work with CTOs and software architects at startups** through the [Microsoft for Startups](https://startups.microsoft.com) and the [Microsoft Cloud Advocates](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/advocates/) programs. I provide advice and help them prioritize, focus, and think deeply about their work. I also take my observations and learnings back into my group at Microsoft to help create better platforms for startups.

I believe the fundamentals of startups are more common than not, no matter where on the globe they are. Of course, there are essential differences in culture, financing, and go-to-market challenges. These differences do have a significant effect on the velocity that’s possible for a startup and the economy it participates in. Despite that, the basic life cycle from ideation to product-market fit to growth remains the same. And so do most of the challenges that CTOs and architects face as their startups grow.

My software development career began in 1995 at a startup in Dallas called The Synapse Group. It was one of the early web interaction agencies. Ben McLemore and Mike Marolda took a chance and hired me out of architecture school to work on some of the very first e-commerce websites, including the first website for [Hilton Hotels](https://hilton.com). The Synapse Group name has almost entirely disappeared through several mergers and only shows up in the [occasional news article archive](https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/1997/09/29/smallb1.html), but the kickstart it gave my career was essential.

Since then, I’ve worked or consulted at several other startups. Many of them have been open source or community driven. Most have either been acquired or have gone out of business. That’s the nature of startups. They bring innovation to the world and then the world integrates that innovation. Even the failures teach us something.

The last startup I was part of was [Wunderlist](https://wunderlist.com), which was bought by Microsoft in 2015. By many measures, it was a successful exit. Staying at Microsoft after the acquisition, however, taught me that there’s more to the story after everyone throws a party and goes home.


Of course, I’m learning from startups during this chapter of my career as well. After all, who knows when I’ll get back into the fray and pursue an idea worth implementing. -->
