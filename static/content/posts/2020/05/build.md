Last week at Build, I hosted two sessions which are now available on-demand:

* [Sarah Novotny on open source and startups](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/76e9de15-7bac-4e00-8997-0ecbcb26f779)
* [Create Resilience](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/565b2a5c-94c9-4080-a64b-6a99653a6db9), with Annie Parker and Amali de Alwis

The Create Resilience session was a version of the conversations that I'm hosting as part of the [Create Online](https://aka.ms/create) series.
