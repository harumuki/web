Decades of work undermined the ability of America to govern itself effectively has resulted in this tragedy, [an incalculable loss](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/24/us/us-coronavirus-deaths-100000.html). Convinced that government was too incapble to govern, and attracted to the prospect of profitably taking it apart, a group of people have managed to make that reality come true through exploiting division and fear.

This is the reality we have created. One where the threat of a virus can't be effectively responded to with the weight it deserves. 

It didn't have to be this way. No matter which party they affiliate with, we should endeavour to put into power people beleive that government is a service to the people, and not an impedement to profit at the public's expense. We can argue about how big or how small government should be. We can keep having the discussion about states rights versus federal rights. We've all got opinions.

But we need to stop the idiocracy. Now.
