title: Tuesday’s musings
---

👩‍🏫 **[Is it safe to send the kids back to school?][1]** That’s a question that Katerina and I have been grappling with ever since our son’s kita opened back up again here in Germany. It’s a very delicate balance between the risks of COVID-19, mental health, and the amazing things our son learns every day when he’s at school. 

🥱 On the other hand, my son and I had a long conversation about why he’s _absolutely bored_ at school while we were on our way there this morning. He’d be happy playing video games all day, instead.

🌥 Basecamp’s **[Hey is running \~90% of their compute on spot instances][2]** via Kubernetes pods, including the entire front-end stack and the bulk of their async background jobs. Very cool.

⛈ May 12th was a bad day at Slack. Laura Nolan has written up the story of how a **[failure in updating the state in Slack’s HAProxy layer][3]** led to progressive deterioration of the service.  

🎍Growing trees to sequester carbon is a good idea. Replace trees with bamboo that you can harvest repeatidly, and you get a pretty great idea: **[the ability to continually grow material for to make engineered construction material for buildings][4]** that has the potential to have a sizable impact on our carbon footprint. A great listen from Asim’s [Climate Fix podcast][5] talking to [Rizome][6].

🍎 Even though recipients of Apple’s new Developer Transition Kit machines aren’t supposed to talk about their performance, **[DTK performance test scores are starting to show up][7]**. Very little credence should be given to these as applies to the machines that will come as it’s an _iPad based CPU in them_, but the results look pretty good considering.

💣 Unlike most of the past twenty years, I haven’t immediately installed macOS 11 or iOS 14 on any of my devices. Yet. I’m sure the time will come sooner or later where I’ll bring them up on a test device.

👋 Have a great Tuesday!
