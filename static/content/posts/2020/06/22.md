🍎 **[WWDC20 starts today](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/)**. I hate to say it, but my enthusiasm is pretty low going into this. Sure, my iMac is getting a little long in the tooth, I’d love to see multi-user support in the iPad for families, and I’m interested to see what the ARM plans turn out to be. But, the whole **[Hey vs Apple](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation)** thing and **[EU antitrust investigation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-antitrust-apple-idUSKBN23N1EP)** throws a miserable cloud of developer discontent over things. I hope to be surprised, however.

📩 Speaking of email, playing with [Hey](https://hey.com/) prompted me to do a bit of re-arranging of my email. No, I’m not committing to Hey yet, but I did clean up the **[email forwarding for my domains using Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net/)**. It’s quick and easy to set up with a few DNS TXT records. Almost too good to be true.

🖥 Kayla Cinnamon and her team continue to crank out great things with **[Windows Terminal Preview 1.1 Release](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-terminal-preview-1-1-release/?WT.mc_id=personal-blog-duncand)**. And the **[Windows Subsystem for Linux picks up GPU support in the latest Insider builds](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/gpu-compute-wsl-install-and-wsl-update-arrive-in-the-windows-insiders-fast-ring-for-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/?WT.mc_id=personal-blog-duncand)**. Even though I work there, it continues to amaze me how far Microsoft has come and I'm really happy to see the company’s developer focus continue to broaden. 

💣 **[Did TikTok users and Kpop fans help deprive Trump of a full rally?](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/21/style/tiktok-trump-rally-tulsa.html)** Or was it that some _very fine_ people had second thoughts about showing up with a pandemic going on? In this day and age, I give more weight to the TikTok’rs and Kpop’rs.

🛳 **[Cruises out of US ports suspended till mid-September](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21297092/cruise-line-us-port-suspension-september-15-covid-19-coronavirus)**.  I can’t imagine getting on a large cruise ship with a pandemic going on. Nope.

💉 My blood type is A-positive, so I wasn’t thrilled to see a study that suggests that **[people with type A blood have a higher risk of COVID-19](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-genes/blood-type-genes-tied-to-risk-of-severe-covid-19-european-study-idUSKBN23P38C)** infections, and worse symptoms to boot.

🦠 Finally, from the _"oh shit, here it comes again"_ department, **[Germany's COVID-19 reproduction rate on Sunday spiked to 2.88](https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-latest-german-reproduction-rate-spikes-60-in-a-day/a-53886880)**. That's up from Saturday's 1.79 and Friday's 1.06. Hopefully, this is attributable to localized outbreak at a meat processing plant where more than 1300 workers recently tested positive. Fingers crossed.
