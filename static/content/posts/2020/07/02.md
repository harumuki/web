title: Thursday’s tidbits

🍔 After hearing for years about it from friends, and after a recent recommendation from my cardiologist, I’m starting giving intermittent fasting a try this week. And of course, what was one of the the primary topics of conversation on a work social hour call right at the end of a fast period? Food.

📲 Of course, the first thing you need when doing something you need to do as a habit is look for an app. There are a lot of apps out there, however. So far, I’ve tried [Zero][1] and [Simple][2]. Any others I should try?

😷 How bad is the pandemic where you live? I really like the **[COVID-19 risk levels dashboard][3]** from the Harvard Global Health Institute for coverage across the United States. It uses a zone based system that categorizes regions into one of four color coded risk levels. [NPR has a lovely write up explaining it in more detail][4].

💉 The **[NYTimes Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker][5]** gives an update on global progress to the one thing that will let us return to normal in the shortest amount of time: a vaccine. 

👨‍🏫 I’m excited about the Microsoft announcements this week about **[skilling for the future][6]** in response to the economic hit of the COVID-19 lockdown and the greatest rise in unemployment since the Great Depression. I do wish that governments were taking the need to address training as seriously.

⛽️ Kudos to **[Basecamp for publishing the results of their first carbon foot printing exercise][7]** and to their commitment to becoming carbon negative. Every company joining this movement matters. 

👋 Stay safe out there. Wear your masks.
