Earlier week at [TEDSummit](https://tedsummit2019.ted.com) in Edinburgh, Chris Anderson told the story of how I met [Katerina](https://talkandinspire.com) in 2012 at a TED event in Doha. It’s hard to beleive that it’s already been seven years since then. A lot has changed. We live in Berlin. We have a three-year old son. And yet... it’s like it was yesterday.
