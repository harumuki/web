Tonight's dish was Mueller chicken.

I didn't plan it that way. I had put in the time and done my usual sous vide preparation, which has never failed before. Tonight's version promised to be up to par. It smelled great. Even the first small taster bite was perfect.

As Katerina and I settled into the second and third bites, however, the story changed. The meat turned tough across sections of the breast. It happens, I've heard, but usually, it's the quality of the chicken that defines how well it turns out when using sous vide. But this was the premium organic stuff. It wasn't supposed to be this way.

So, I named it Mueller chicken. Something we really were really looking forward to but were ultimately so dissapointed by.
