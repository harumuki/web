Joanna Sttn had an idea for an article to illustrate the frustration [when something goes wrong with Apple's butteryfly keyboards](https://www.wsj.com/graphics/apple-still-hasnt-fixed-its-macbook-keyboard-problem/).

The best part is how the article renders Apple's apology:

> “W a awa tthatt a small numb of uss a having issus witth tthi tthid-gnattion buttttfly kyboad and fo tthatt w a soy,” an Appl spoksman said in a sttattmntt. “TTh vastt majoitty of Mac nottbook custtoms a having a posittiv xpinc witth tth nw kyboad.” If you hav a poblm, conttactt Appl custtom svic, h addd.

Yep. That's about what it feels like.
