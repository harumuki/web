The April fool's day joke on Berlin this year is a full-on BVG strike, shutting down the U-Bahn, tram, and bus systems in the city. The resulting rush for taxis left my friend without a way to get to the airport this morning, so I drove her there. At least I attempted to. It's usually a twenty-minute drive to Tegal. After almost an hour, however, we got stuck on a highway offramp for a half hour just a kilometer away from the terminal.

Totally stuck. We maybe moved 50 meters.

People started getting out of their cars and walking to the airport. At first by ones and twos and then as a flood. At some point, my friend said, "Ok, I'm out." She hopped out, grabbed her bag and joined the hikers, and rushed to make her flight. Me, I stayed on that overpass for more than another half hour watching people stream by.
