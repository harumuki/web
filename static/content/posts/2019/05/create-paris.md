We had a great time at [Create Startups](https://www.createstartups.io/) in Paris this last Tuesday at [Numa](https://www.numa.co/). At this stop, we changed our format to a half-day single track in the afternoon with four presentations plus a keynote. Even though it's a challenge to get in all the information we want in just a half-day, it felt like the right length for an audience of this size and what we're trying to do.

Next stop, [Mumbai](https://www.createstartups.io/mumbai). I won't be able to be there, but [Chad Fowler](https://twitter.com/chadfowler) will be giving the keynote, so I know it's going to go well!
