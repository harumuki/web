There are so many new geeky announcements this week coming out of Microsoft's [Build Conference](https://mybuild.techcommunity.microsoft.com/). 

My favorites are, in no particular order: [VS Code Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview?WT.mc_id=personal-blog-duncand), which will enable [cloud hosted development environments](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/intelligent-productivity-and-collaboration-from-anywhere/?WT.mc_id=personal-blog-duncand); [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/announcing-wsl-2/?WT.mc_id=personal-blog-duncand), which will bring a full Linux kernel into Windows (What? No way!) and massively speed up the experience; and a new [Windows Terminal](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-windows-terminal/?WT.mc_id=personal-blog-duncand) with a modern interface and a new font, complete with programming ligatures!
