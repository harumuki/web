The real emergency is the climate. Greta Thunberg, an autistic 16 year old from Sweden [says everything that needs to be said](https://www.ted.com/talks/greta_thunberg_the_disarming_case_to_act_right_now_on_climate):

I don't understand that, because if the emissions have to stop, then we must stop the emissions. To me that is black or white. There are no gray areas when it comes to survival. Either we go on as a civilization or we don't. We have to change.
