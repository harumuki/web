Anna Machin writes in Aeon about why [only humans have involved and empathetic fathers](https://aeon.co/essays/the-devotion-of-the-human-dad-separates-us-from-other-apes).

> ...given the parsimonious nature of evolution, human fatherhood – with its complex anatomical, neural, physiological and behavioural changes – would not have emerged unless the investment that fathers make in their children is vital for the survival of our species.

Rough and tumble play between dads and kids serves a purpose, it turns out. Now, I just have to make sure to be in good enough shape as I get old to keep it up with my son.
