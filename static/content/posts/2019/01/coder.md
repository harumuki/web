On a recommendation from [Brian Ketelsen](https://www.brianketelsen.com), I signed up for a [Coder.com](https://coder.com/) account, and I'm seriously impressed. It's a Linux shell running in a container with a Visual Studio Code instance that runs in your browser. It can scale on-demand up to 96 cores for when you need some serious development horsepower.

It's still in alpha, and I've found a few rough corners, but it's already usable and is damned impressive. In fact, I'm writing, testing, and posting this post from Coder.com in my browser.
