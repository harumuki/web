Today was my first day back at the office after the holidays, and I was finally able to take my damaged MacBook Pro into service. The initial prognosis is a dead motherboard. Not good. If that is indeed the case, that means all the data on the hard drive (which is soldered onto the motherboard) will be gone when they fix it.

Good thing that everything that I cared about on that machine is also in the cloud somewhere.
