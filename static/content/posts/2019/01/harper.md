I met Harper Reed years ago at ORDCamp and then at TED 2013, where [he predicted that foreign hackers would target American elections](https://www.recode.net/2016/12/18/13998756/obama-technologist-predict-election-tampering-harper-reed-ted-talk). We could have listened a bit more.

These days, Harper is taking a lot of photographs.
