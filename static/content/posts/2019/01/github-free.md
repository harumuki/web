Pushed up a day thanks to a leak, GitHub has made [unlimited private repositories](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1082345111566970880) available for developers on the free plan. Most people on the Pro plan probably have it because of wanting to have a few more private repositories. Now, there's no need to pay for that.

What happens if you keep paying for the Pro? You can look at the [pricing page](https://github.com/pricing) for all the details, but as far as I'm concerned, the big reason to pay for Pro is having unlimited collaborators on a private project. If you don't use this, then you can probably stop paying.

Unless, of course, you find yourself liking [the new Pro features](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1082364480120532992) which arrive in the future. Whatever they might happen to be.
