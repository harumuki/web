title: Titles optional
---

As I build up this iteration of my blog, I'm setting it up without the hard requirement that every post has a title. That's a change from almost every blog system that I've used or wrote over the years.

There's an operational simplicity in having a hard requirement of having at title with each post, which is probably why many web content management sytems have stuck with it. It certainly makes it slightly easier to pour content into RSS or into formatted blocks of HTML.

On the other hand, I think one of the things that make posting on Twitter or Facebook appealing is the minimal ceremony involved: just start typing without the thought of, "what is the title of what I'm about to write."
