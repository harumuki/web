title: It goes to 11

🍎 It's official. **[Apple is switching Macs to it's own silicon](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020)**, starting this year. The way they're doing it makes total sense based on their previous transitions. And stuffing an iPad CPU inside a Mac mini case as a hardware prototype for developers to use before final hardware ships is a pretty cool trick. It doesn't let anything out of the bag on what Apple is planning for hardware, but gets the job done. Barring accidents, the Macs I have now will be the last I own with Intel chips.

💪 If I get a Surface Pro X, or a future version of it, for my day-job work, there's a chance all of my day-to-day devices could be ARM-based. That's a really interesting future to consider. And yet, **[Intel stock price is up today](https://www.bing.com/search?q=intel%20stock%20price&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&ghc=1&pq=intel%20stock%20pri&sc=6-15&sk=&cvid=D722EAACB0A2475D88F9AE0FCB401967)**.

❌ The new version of Apple's desktop OS is dropping the X and going to be called **[macOS 11](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/22/macos-big-sur-is-version-11-0/)**. The X has been around for two decades, and while I'm not sad to go, it deserves a moment of nostalgia.

📧 **[Hey and Apple found a temporary truce](https://hey.com/apple/path/)** just before WWDC kicked off. It's nice to have some resolution, even if it's temporary, and not have this hanging over the week. I have a feeling that this won't be the last we'll see of this particular negotation in public. And I, for one, hope that the results lead to a better outcome for all developers.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **[Microsoft Teams is starting to go personal](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298766/microsoft-teams-personal-launch-preview-accounts)**. The ability to log into Teams using a personal account in addition to an organization account will be rolling out across Android and iOS versions of the app. 

🧑🏿 The Information reports that **[only 2.7% of top roles in big tech are held by black executives](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/just-2-7-of-top-roles-in-big-tech-held-by-black-executives?utm_content=article-4592)**. White execs, along with the rest of us white folks, in those companies have a lot of work to do on implicit biases.
