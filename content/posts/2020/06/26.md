title: It's Friday, again
---

🤣 The weeks keep speeding by. Every Friday, Katerina and I look at each other and ask "Wasn't it just Friday a day or two ago?" If we keep this up, it'll be 2021 before we know it. Hopefully, we're on fast forward to a better world.

🦠 The New York Times **[interactive of the spread of COVID-19](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-spread.html)** is sobering, including this: Up to 22,000 deaths in New York City could have been prevented if social distancing had been started a week earlier.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **[10 to 20 percent of infected people may drive 80 percent of new COVID-19 cases](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-superspreading-events-drive-most-covid-19-spread1/)**.  I don't know about you, but even though I don't want to be a hermit, I'm planning on skipping in-person conferences and events until there's a widely deployed vaccine.

⛅ It's amazing how much the cloud providers have built out so far during the pandemic. **[Azure added 110 terabits of bandwidth to its fiber optic network](https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/azure-covid-19/)** in two months. I'm looking forward to seeing even more data like this from all the cloud providers.

🤖 Turning the focus away from the pandemic, I was excited to see that Github's **[Dependabot now performs version updates](https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/)**, keeping dependencies managed by several popular packages managers nicely up to date. All you need to do is set up a `.github/dependabot.yml` file in your repository ([see docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates)) and the system takes care of the rest.
