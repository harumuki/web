title: Plastic not so fantastic
---

ü•§ **[ Used plastic isn‚Äôt all that valuable, and has never been][1]**, according to NPR and PBS Frontline. All that effort you‚Äôve been making to separate plastics‚Ä¶ It might well be for naught, depending on where you live. Less than 10% of all plastic has _ever_ been recycled. Furthermore, it can‚Äôt be used more than once or twice since it degrades every time it is recycled. 

‚ôª According to the EPA, **[8.7% of plastics were recycled in 2017 in the United States.][2]** Everything else was burned, landfilled, or ended up discarded in nature. The most recycled plastics: PET (recycling code 1) and HDPE (recycling code 2) bottles, which had recycling rates of 29% and 31% respectively.

üåä The ocean is the final destination for quite a lot of plastic. An estimated **[8 million metric tons of plastic ends up in the oceans][3]** every year. Given that half of the total plastics in the world were made in the last 13 years, well, that‚Äôs probably only going to get worse.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ‚Äç What to do? **[We have to stop the use of single use plastic.][4]** Easier said than done, I know. Consumer choice isn‚Äôt enough. We need to demand that the companies that make the products we use change.
