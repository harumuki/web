🌍 It's pretty obvious that **[climate change is now locked in.][1]** _"Managing climate change, experts said, will require rethinking virtually every aspect of daily life: how and where homes are built, how power grids are designed, how people plan for the future with the collective good in mind."_ We won't be able to escape the impact, but we still have time to moderate and adapt to the change.

📅 40 days until the **[election that could break America.][2]** Baron Gellman at the Atlantic: _“Donald Trump may win or lose, but he will never concede. Not under any circumstance. Not during the Interregnum and not afterward. If compelled in the end to vacate his office, Trump will insist from exile, as long as he draws breath, that the contest was rigged.”_ I keep having this conversation with people here in Europe who can't quite beleive that an Amercian election could be so contested. It just doesn't make sense if you didn't grow up with it.

🤴 **[Hear it from Trump's mouth directly:][3]** _“Get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very peaceful — there won’t be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation”_

😱 I know. I'm depressed now too. 

🗽 **Democracy matters.**
