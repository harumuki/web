📲 **[iOS 14 is out.][0]** Finally, the updates to the home screen arrive, letting us put widgets on our screens and hideaway apps that we don’t use all the time into an App Center. I’m considering removing _all_ the apps from my home screen and then adding back in just the ones I use often. It feels both kind of extreme and like it might be a cleansing experience.

📝 **[Everynote’s big rewrite has started shipping.][2]** The previous version of the application had grown into a mess that was preventing the company from shipping new features, a situation for which I have a lot of sympathy having been in a similar situation.

📅 **47 days, y’all.** Got your plan to vote? I’m still waiting on my ballot to arrive here in Beriln… and getting a bit stressed out. I’m definitely considering to use FedEx to send it back to the states.
