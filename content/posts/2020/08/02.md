✊🏿 **[Calendly founder Tope Awotona’s story about overcoming challenges is amazing][1]**. I love his closing thought: _“You can dwell on all the reasons you shouldn't do something or why it's harder for you. Or you can just go out and do it”_

🏡 Harvard Business Review has published a report about **[how employees adapted to being remote over these last months][2]**. A surprising tidbit: The number of 1 hour meetings actually went down in favor of an increased number of 30 minute meetings. 

☎️ Personally, I’m a fan of the 20 minute online meeting. It gives time for a bit of note taking between calls, or even a quick bio break. Of course, the number of meetings that could _still_ be an email discussion is too high.

🌍 **[Vox’s explainer on Microsoft’s climate change initiatives is a good read][3]**. I appreciate that it points out where the company can do better as well, including critiques of helping the oil industry continue to extract carbon from the earth and its weak public policy actions.
