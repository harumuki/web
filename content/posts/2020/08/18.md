🏖 Our summer vacation continues on, with extremely bad mobile phone coverage and an almost non-existent DSL connection keeping most random web surfing to a minimum. Maybe that’s not so bad right now. Still, a few things have caught my eye the last few days:

🚘 **[Volvo’s claim that they have rights to use photos posted on Instagram][1]** and other social media sites pretty is despicable. Volvo is claiming all public Instagram posts are fair game and can be taken and used freely. As well, they claim that if an image is tagged “Volvo,” that provides an implied license to use. What asshats.

📷 On the flip side, Google’s **[new license information feature in Google Images][2]** is pretty interesting. It’s hard to say if this will change anything in public perception of how image licensing works, but at least it’s a good message to people at companies who are looking to pick up and use images they find on the Internet for free.

🌎 **[2020 may be the year when the politics of climate change is fundamentally transformed][3]**. Jeff Goodell writes in Rolling Stone: _“Biden’s climate plan is a clear sign that he understands how much is at stake in this election. But we’re still in the early days of a long fight to repair the ravages of the past and to maintain a habitable planet.”_ Biden will have my vote regardless (assuming that I can get it in from Europe), but I’m happy to say that it won’t just be because I oppose Trump having another four years in office.
