During my time as TED’s main stage photographer, I got to meet so many amazing people that I continue to make sure to keep tabs on in one way or another. Dr. Zeynep Tufecki is one of these people, and the longer I follow her online and read what she writes, the more I’m astounded by her clear thinking and way of communication. 

So, it was no surprise when I saw Ben Smith’s article in the New York Times titled **[How Zeynep Tufekci Keeps Getting the Big Things Right][1]**. No surprise at all, but I’m extremely happy that she’s getting the recognition she deserves.
