Well America, [that's one hell of a way to start the new year][1]. 

The drone killing of Soleimani reads to me (and probably about half the population of the planet) as President Trump playing a massive distraction card before his impeachment trial is set to start. 

It doesn't help that the support for this action is, predictably, split right along partisan lines -- the same lines which have been undermining the way the United States government has operated for generations, and which the likely upcoming impeachment trial result of an acquittal for Trump will likely continue to erode.
