Number one on [Fred Wilson's list of what will happen this decade](https://avc.com/2020/01/what-will-happen-in-the-2020s/): we begin to re-allocate captial to address the climate crisis:

> The looming climate crisis will be to this century what the two world wars were to the previous one. It will require countries and institutions to re-allocate capital from other endeavors to fight against a warming planet. This is the decade we will begin to see this re-allocation of capital. 

As I head back to work this year, this is at the top of my mind.
