If unchecked, Trump's action to kill Soleimani may be the final nail in the coffin for the US Constitution. 

Whatever you think of it, the way in which it executed shred whatever government norms are left at this point and bypass any oversight of the executive branch by congress. I can't see how this isn't effectively the action of an autocrat who is enabled by his party's compliance and unflinching, unquestioning, and relentless loyalty.
