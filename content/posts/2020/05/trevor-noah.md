[Trevor Noah talking about the protests](https://youtu.be/v4amCfVbA_c?t=843):

> There's never a right way to protest, because that's what protest is. It cannot be right because you are protesting against a thing that is stopping you. 

Everyone should watch all 18 minutes of [this thoughtful monologue](https://youtu.be/v4amCfVbA_c). That goes double if you're white.
