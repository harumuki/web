Tim O'Reilly looks forward at how to [plan for the post-COVID world](https://www.oreilly.com/tim/21stcentury/).

> When we look back, we will understand that the 21st century truly began this year, when the COVID19 pandemic took hold. We are entering the century of being blindsided by things that we have been warned about for decades but never took seriously enough to prepare for, the century of lurching from crisis to crisis until, at last, we shake ourselves from the illusion that our world will go back to the comfortable way it was and begin the process of rebuilding our society from the ground up.

We have difficult decisions to make and it's time to start doing some strategic planning to help us along the way.
