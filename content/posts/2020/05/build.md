Last week at Build, I hosted two sessions which are now available on-demand:

* Sarah Novotny on open source and startups
* Create Resilience, with Annie Parker and Amali de Alwis

The Create Resilience session was a version of the conversations that I'm hosting as part of the [Create Online](https://aka.ms/create) series.
