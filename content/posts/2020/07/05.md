title: Weekend tidbits and links
---

🌟It was a lazy weekend in Berlin for Team Davidson. No fireworks, but there was a food truck in the neighborhood selling great spare ribs and burgers. 

🍎 What will we see in future Apple Silicon-based devices? **[Jason Snell speculates on the changes that might be coming to the Mac][1]**. Touchscreens are table stakes, in my opinion, as is FaceID for authentication. I’m really interested in seeing what happens.

📦 The recently announced ability to use Azure as a development context for local Docker container development is cool, and is **[now available with the latest Docker Desktop Edge][2]**. This should be a great way to collaborate, test, and, in a pinch, deploy.

🛍 Despite a write-off of almost a half a billion dollars, **[Om argues that Microsoft had to close its retail stores][3]**. The reason? Microsoft is doubling down on its core strength of being a developer and enterprise focused company and is removing distractions. 

👨‍🏫 Giving presentations online is a different proposition than doing them in person. **[Venkat Subramaniam shares his observations about how to be effective online][4]**.

🦠 **[Work continues to establish where the COVID-19 virus came from][5]**, and the path may lead to an abandoned mine 1000 miles away from Wuhan. Meanwhile, **[evidence mounts that the virus lingers in air indoors][6]**. I can’t help but think of all the air conditioned spaces where I grew up in Texas and Oklahoma.

🧲 In nicer science news, magnetic fields are amazing. Full stop. They might also **[answer why the universe is expanding faster than our current understanding of its component ingredients would predict][7]**. If, that is, observations of faint magnetic fields a millionth of a trillionth as strong as a fridge magnet’s are a clue.

👋 Have a good week ahead.
