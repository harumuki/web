üßÄ After a few days test driving intermittent fasting at the 14 hour a day level, which isn‚Äôt really too much at all to deal with, I‚Äôm going to ramp it up this week to 16 hours ‚Äî leaving an 8 hour a day window to eat. The hardest part for me so far is to control the urge to stuff my face with all sorts of sweets and junk food during the eating window.

üò∑ Berlin‚Äôs transit operator **[BVG is launching a campaign to encourage people to wear their masks correctly over their nose][1]** by asking people to skip the deodorant. Hilarious! 

‚è∞ That feeling where every moment seems to drag, yet the weeks are flying by? Caspar Addyman calls this **[Quarantime][2]**, where being in the same environment everyday means that there aren‚Äôt as many new distinct memories being made. This makes time both drag in the short term and almost disappear in the medium term. (Via [@katy\_milkman][3])

ü§¨ We‚Äôre really going to have to work on how we think of people who make significant contributions to society, and yet who are still horrible people. One example is Nobel Prize winner William B. Shockley who helped invent the transistor and whose semiconductor laboratory launched Silicon Valley. Yet, **[Shockley was also a white supremacist and eugenics proponent][4]**. 

üöô Speaking of people with complexities, I really really _really_ want my next car to be 100% electric, but I‚Äôm hesitant to buy a Tesla. From a fitness perspective, the Model 3 pretty much sets the bar. And, I‚Äôm very grateful that Telsa has pushed the industry and state of the art so far. However, I‚Äôm really conflicted on supporting Elon Musk in the process. I might have to look more at the **[Volkswagen ID.3][5]** when it (hopefully) arrives later this year.

‚ò†Ô∏è Of course, [Volkswagen has Hitler and the Nazi‚Äôs to thank][6] for its existence. So, there‚Äôs that.
