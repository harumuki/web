ðŸ’‰ The entire process of approaching travel this summer is so very different, if youâ€™re able to contemplate it at all. The fact we live in a world where it seems perfectly reasonable to drop off a couple of PCR test swab specimens a few days before you fly is justâ€¦ wow.

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· Greece is open, at least if you reside in the EU+ or a dozen or so other countries. Thereâ€™s also a process. First, you have to fill out an online form called a Passenger Locator Form (PLF) before you go so that they can find you once youâ€™re in the country. Then, the **[Greek arrival protocols][1]** involve using a QR code on arrival to see if you are chosen to be tested. Itâ€™s actually not quite as strict as I would have expected. I think they should test everyone on arrival, myself.

ðŸ†˜ Even once you decide to travel, I think itâ€™s definitely a good idea to make sure that you can respond to changes. Local lockdowns will happen in seemingly random places. A surge of infections could take off at any time. Country closures can come and go in a blink of an eye. Having a thorough plan of what youâ€™d do in a variety of situations seems pretty essential to me.
