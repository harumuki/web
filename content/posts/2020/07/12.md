✊🏿 I’m glad to see that **[the Linux team is moving to more inclusive terminology][1]**.  And, best of all, the proposed terms are better descriptions of the concepts that they are labeling.

♻️ My colleague **[Asim Hussain was interviewed on how he’s been able to incubate a green advocacy team][2]** at Microsoft. He’s been doing a lot of work on the idea of [sustainable software engineering][3], and I’d like to look at how we can encourage those ideas in startups.

🦠 **[Wired’s follow up interview with Larry Brilliant on how well we’re fighting COVID-19][4]** in an age of total failure of the United States government to respond is a sobering read. It’s instructive to read how he’s dealing with day-to-day life. He’s not taking Clorox to his deliveries and groceries, but he is worried about face-to-face transmission.

📷 **[The Canon EOS R5 is the spiritual successor the impressive 5D-series of cameras][5]**, especially the genre-smashing Canon 5D Mark II. It looks to be an amazing camera for Canon gear heads, and sets a significant bar for Nikon and Sony. I’m going to have to give it a try sometime after it makes its appearance. Of course, that means finding a bit of my photo-mojo again. 

☎️ Given my employer and how much I use the product, I wouldn’t be surprised if there’s a **[Microsoft Teams hardware][6]** display in my future. On the other hand, I kind of have this at home when I’m using both my MacBook Pro or iMac and my Surface Laptop together, except for that whole having a decent camera thing.

😕 That feeling when you want to get away and travel but can’t? **[There’s a German word for that: Fernweh][7]**. A pain to see far away places. It’s more than wanderlust. It’s the opposite of homesickness. 

👋 That’s it for now. I hope you have a good week ahead — at least as good as we can all manage right about now.
