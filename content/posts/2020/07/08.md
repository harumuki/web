title: Thursdayâ€™s reading

ðŸŒ® Iâ€™m up to 16 hours of intermittent fasting as of today. Iâ€™m not going to lie, the last hour this morning before I broke fast was really tough. Also tough: making the kiddo breakfast and not munching any of it myself. Argh.

ðŸ¦  Since the coronavirus crisis started, the Microsoft AI for Health team has been doing a lot of work to help understand its impact. The data has been really useful for internal planning, and Iâ€™m really glad to see it published as  a set of **[interactive visualizations to understand our progress against COVID-19][1]**.

ðŸŒ¡ Just because there are other things occupying our minds doesnâ€™t mean the climate crisis is going away. **[June was the second warmest on record here in Europe][2]**. Weâ€™ll see what July brings as itâ€™s been cool here in Berlin so far this month.

ðŸ›« Itâ€™s kind of a crazy idea to **[use direct air capture of carbon dioxide to make jet fuel][3]**, but itâ€™s kind of a beautiful one as well. Net-zero air travel with current aviation hardware would be amazing.

ðŸŽ² Randomness has always been something that computers have a hard time with, but Venkat Mansinghkaâ€™s group at MIT is going to present **[a new algorithm called Fast Loaded Dice Roller (FLDR)][4]** that may be able to free us from too much determinism and make for better simulations. 

ðŸ‘‹ Ok, back to work for me. Catch ya later.
