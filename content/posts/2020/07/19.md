🚴‍♂️ Kids in Germany start on two wheels using a [laufrad][1], also known as a balance bike. Basically, it’s a tiny bicycle without the pedals. After a year or two running around getting the hang of balance, steering, and stopping, it’s a short hop to a bike with pedals. Mr. 4 made the transition yesterday and I’m so proud.
