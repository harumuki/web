title: Six for Friday

📲 Are my days of dual carrying mobile devices about to start again? Looks like the **[Microsoft Surface Duo device is getting ready to launch][1]**.  I’m really curious to see what it’ll feel like in hand.

📢 The **[Cascadia Code font now has multiple weights][2]**, as announced by [Kayla in the Windows Terminal blog][3]. I use it as my code font on Mac OS X via [Homebrew][4].

📸 The **[AP is going to equip all of its visual journalists with Sony gear.][5]** That’s pretty massive, but and makes sense to be able to have all of their photojournalists using the same basic kit based around the E-mount, from stills to video.

😱 During the flights we took on Wednesday, I saw one person wearing a **[chef’s transparent saliva shield][6]**.  Technically, I guess it _is_ a covering of the nose and mouth, but I think the person was seriously missing the point.

😷 **[Delta has already banned 100 people for refusing to wear a mask][7]**.  Delta CEO Ed Bastian: _"If you board the plane and insist on not wearing a mask, we insist that you do not fly Delta into the future.“_  That’s an airline policy I can support 100%.

👨‍⚕️ I can’t imagine how Antony Fauci manages to keep going to work day after day. This quote from **[Fauci’s interview with New York Times Opinion writer Jennifer Senior][8]** is downright depressing: _"But Jennifer, would you want me to say something that’s directly contrary to what the president is doing? That’s not helpful. Then all of a sudden you don’t hear from me for a while.”_ I couldn’t do it, myself.
