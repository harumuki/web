🏗 One of our regular grocery stories in the neighborhood is now a pile of rubble. Besides being a fairly ugly East German relic, it was what the city planners call a “flat man,” a single story single use building that doesn’t efficiently use urban space. In a couple of years, it’ll be [a 6-story residential building with a new grocery store at the bottom][1]. 

💶 Two of the German startups in the Microsoft for Startups program just had some major fundraises: **[LeanIX raised a $80 million Series D][2]** and **[Userlane raised a €10 million Series B][3]**. It’s really cool to see companies that we’ve helped continue to grow, despite all the uncertainty in the world.

📷 As part of the massive acceleration to online learning, **[the Nikon School UK is closing down in London][4]**. Going online, they’re able to expand their reach worldwide. Sure, it’s nice to learn in person, but I really love that this trend is opening up access overall.

⛈ I really like the idea of Terraform, but each time I look deeply into it for managing Azure resources, I get tripped up over lags in the feature set. For example,**[ the Terraform azure\_cdn\_endpoint configuration directive doesn’t support custom domains][5]** yet even though custom domains have  been supported by the Microsoft Azure CDN for a while. That was the end of today’s attempt, at least.
