🚶‍♂️ On my daily walks lately, my eye has been turning towards views that are urban and have the mark of people, but without the people themselves. It’s kind of a dark dystopian thing, but that’s the time we live in right now.

🐦 **[Twitter’s blue checkmark hack is terrifying][1]**. Admin tools, by definition, give too much access and are tempting targets to attack because of that, but it sounds like Twitter’s going to need to do a pretty big revamp of how they implement the [principle of least privilege][2] in their admin tools. 

🔒 If you leverage Twitter as an identity provider to log into other services, I think right now is a good time to re-evaluate that decision. 

💸 My eyes popped when I saw that **[TikTok has agreed to buy more than $800 million in cloud services from Google Cloud][3]** over three years. Holy smokes, I can’t help but think that something could be more efficient in their codebase.

😍 I am excited about **[Matt Aimonetti joining Microsoft][4]**. He’s joining a different team than mine, but I am looking forward to talking with him about how we can improve how Microsoft helps out startups.

☕️ I thought I’d satisfied my inner coffee nerd living in Portland for all those years, but no. [Oren sent me down a rabbit-hole][5] by mentioning **[the Decent Espresso machine][6]**. Uh oh. That might be the new toy for this fall when the days get short again.

👋 Stay safe out there. Wear a mask and review how you structure your identity online.
