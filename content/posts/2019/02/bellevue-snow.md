Waking up in my hotel room, I saw a message from my colleague — who I’d planned to go into the office with first thing in the morning to catch up on life — saying, “Guess I won’t be going into the office with you today.”

“Wha? Wha? Wha?” I thought, “Did I wake up too late? Shit.” Man, I was really looking forward to catching up.

I opened up the windows and saw a bit of snow. Nothing serious, but dammit, I wish I had brought a bigger jacket with me on this trip. Then I opened my laptop and saw messages talking about snow everywhere and offices being closed. Shuttles weren’t running. Everybody was recommending staying home and working remotely.

I finally got that my colleague wasn’t telling me that he had already left. Welcome to Seattle. A couple of inches of snow and no snow equipment equals total shutdown. Alright then. Luckily, he was staying at the hotel next to mine, so we met up and had a long coffee and then lunch and really caught up. Perfect.
