“Will you move back home?” It’s a question I get from people now and then, especially from the family where home means back to America. My answer is always swift: “For sure, not soon.”

”Why not?” is the predictable question.

There are dozens of reasons, but the one that comes first to my mind is always this: I don’t want my child ever having to take part in an active shooter drill at school. It’s such a uniquely American thing at this point in history, and so completely and utterly unimaginable to me, now that I live outside the states.
