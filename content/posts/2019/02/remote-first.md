Being on a remote first team means that instead of having to miss your group’s all-hands meeting scheduled for 00:30 your local time, you can wake up the next morning and instantly watch a recording of the meeting and be up-to-date on the conversation happening in Slack (or Teams). I’m glad to be on such a team.
