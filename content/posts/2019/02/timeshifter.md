After hearing several good reviews, I’ve been playing with [Timeshifter](https://www.timeshifter.com/) to help with jet lag. From their marketing material:

> Generic jet lag advice is, well… generic. It won’t reduce your jet lag and can actually make it worse. Each traveler and trip is different and requires a personalized approach taking your sleep pattern, chronotype, itinerary, and a range of personal preferences into account.

After two trips, the advice the app generates has been working really well. It doesn’t eliminate _all_ the symptoms of jet lag for me, but the fairly mild symptoms I do have on longer trips are compacted nicely into just a few days. The app isn’t cheap to use, but anything that helps beat jet lag is worth a lot.

I think I’m going to have to extensively update my own [jet lag advice article](/essays/jetlag/).
