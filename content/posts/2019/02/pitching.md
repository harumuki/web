[Pitching is broken](https://sifted.eu/articles/pitching-process-broken-microsoft-for-startups/), argues my colleague Ian McDonald. In the London office, Microsoft for Startups no longer requires a pitch. Instead, they use an intake form and then interview.

> Isn’t it much better to explicitly ask people for information, rather than hoping that they’ll give you the information in a short pitch? How are people who haven’t seen a pitch deck or worked with VCs before meant to know what they are being judged on? The tech industry is (unconsciously) excluding people who don’t have an understanding of, and connections into, the startup ecosystem. 

The only counterpoint I can make is that a good pitch shows that a company knows how to communicate what they’re selling. A company that can’t pitch their product is going to have a hard time with marketing. But, for what we do, that shouldn’t be a barrier to filter on. It should instead be something we work with companies to do better.
