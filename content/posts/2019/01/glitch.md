Take an iPhone while riding (not driving!) in a car. Start a panoramic shot while the car is in motion and let the iPhone use the car's motion to paint the frame. Don't try too hard to smooth out any bumps and certainly don't try to avoid streelights as they go by. The result is a lovely glitchy view of the world that's entirely the result of a computational process doing the best it can with the input you give it.
