The 2019 edition of [ORDCamp](https://ordcamp.com) is a wrap and man, I’m so glad I was able to go. Not only is it one of the best unconferences in the word (along with KiwiFoo and the original Foo Camp), but it’s a place where I’ve been able to reconnect with people from various parts of the last twenty years of my life. Being able to do this was especially important to me this year [because, well, reasons](/essays/lucky/) meant that I had to decline my invitation last year.
