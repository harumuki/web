[MSNBC correspondent Trymaine Lee had a heart at age 38](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/opinion/sunday/heart-attack-young-men.html):

> Like other survivors of near-death experiences, some heart attack victims will develop post-traumatic stress disorder. Some will fall into anxiety and depression. They’ll wonder, “Why me?” Others will become hypervigilant, waiting for another heart attack to strike. I found myself replaying the terrifying moments of my heart attack, trapped in a cycle of fear and resignation — fear of dying and resignation that it was probably going to happen sooner rather than later.

After [my own trip to the ER](/essays/lucky/) in 2017, my primary feeling was one of gratitude. Gratitude for being alive. Gratitude for getting another chance.

But every so often, there was the fear. Every ache and pain got further introspection, just to be sure. And heartburn? Oh man, heartburn freaks my shit out, every, single time. It doesn’t help that one of the medicines I take daily now causes it.
