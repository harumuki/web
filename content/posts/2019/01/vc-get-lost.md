Some startups are fed up with the growth at all costs mindset and are rejecting the model that’s been tech’s foundation. Essentially, they are [telling venture capitalists to get lost](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/technology/start-ups-rejecting-venture-capital.html), and are asking some profound questions along the way:

> Would Facebook’s leadership have ignored warning signs of Russian election meddling or allowed its platform to incite racial violence if it hadn’t, in its early days, prized moving fast and breaking things? Would Uber have engaged in dubious regulatory and legal strategies if it hadn’t prioritized expansion over all else?

It’s hard to know for sure, but the culture a company starts with indeed continues to inform it for years and decades after.
