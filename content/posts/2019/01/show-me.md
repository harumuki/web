"Hey," she says, "can you show me what you're doing? Every time I see you working on your site, I see a black window with some mumbo-jumbo in it."

"That's the terminal," I reply, "and this the command that builds the site. It launches a process to build the stylesheet and another to build the pages. And over here in this window is where I write."

"Because I'm a geek and I want control over what I'm doing. Besides, these are all technologies that I've been interested in now for a long time, and it's good practice."

"Can you tell if somebody has made their own site or not?"

"Not if you do it right, although there are always clues. Little details that probably only matter to a small number of people. Dorks like me."

"Oh. OK. I think I'm going to go back to bed."
