I'm not a big fan of the currently fashionable "iPhones are bad, mâ€™kay!" thinking. Yes, there are apps and social networks that are bad, but the technology itself is neutral. After spending a day without my phone while it was in getting a new camera module, however, I will admit that it was really nice spending some time away from it.

Sitting on the train, for example, with no magic device in hand was a treat. I just watched the scenery going by. The people getting on and off. The signs and graffiti. I enjoyed the space to think without somebody elses thoughts jumping in at any moment.

I might have to do that again. On purpose.
