I took my iPhone into the Apple Store today to get its camera fixed. Somehow, one of the elements in this telephoto lens cracked over the holidays. The service people hadn't seen anything quite like it, and I'm sure they've seen their share of weird stuff. Since there was no external damage and all the diagnostics checked out, however, Apple is fixing it under warranty.

Funny thing: on the way home, I almost got a ticket from a fare inspector on the train. I'd hadn't thought it through that my monthly fare card was on my phone, which wasn't with me. Oops. Luckily, the inspector accepted my excuse and let me off with a warning. Whew.
