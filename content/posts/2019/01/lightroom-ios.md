We’ll know that the iPad is really ready to take over from a laptop when it’s no longer a ridiculous process to get photos from an SD card directly into Lightroom. At least [now there’s a Siri Shortcut that can be set up to do it](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18179319/adobe-lightroom-cc-siri-shortcut-import-camera-roll-ios-ipad-pro).

It’s slightly less ridiculous, but I really hope we’ll see something better this summer when Apple announces their next set of OS updates.
