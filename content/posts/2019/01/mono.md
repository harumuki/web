No matter how long I live in Europe, no matter where else in the world I go, the American west has a very special place in my heart. And, seeing [Mono lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_Lake) out the window on a flight puts the biggest smile on my face and brings back memories of the time I spent exploring around it.

Such a magical place.
