Now that the silly season is well done, maybe it’s time to go back and look at the [second volume of of the National Climate Assessment (NCA2018)](https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/)(https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/). While buried on Black Friday --- presumably to keep it out of the news cycle --- it’s endorsed by most of the executive branch’s departments and agencies, including the Defense and State Departments.

> Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century.

It doesn’t get much more clear cut than that. The real debate isn’t what’s going to happen, but what we’re going to do about it.
