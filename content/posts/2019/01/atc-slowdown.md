Waking up to news of the [Air Traffic Control slowdown of traffic](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/nyregion/airports-shutdown-laguardia-faa.html) wasn’t pleasant this morning. While the rational thought is just a small bump, we’re in the kind of climate where it feels like anything is possible. This could be just the start of something bigger, and that would be just the kind of massive side effect you could expect from the insanity of the current government shutdown.

Compounding the feeling is that a big part of my team at work is traveling around the world right now. But really, we’ll be ok. The game plan if any of us gets stuck is to stay put in a nice warm hotel room until we can fly again. It’s an inconvenience, but we’ll get through it.

Still, I hate the feeling that anything could happen.
