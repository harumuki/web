[Jasmine Greenaway](https://twitter.com/paladique) and [Burke Holland](https://twitter.com/burkeholland) used a bunch of statistics and a little bit of machine learning to attempt to decipher who is behind the Twitter parody account @horse_js](https://twitter.com/horse_js).

> This leads us to believe that if we looked at who @horse_js quotes most often, we could examine common followers of all of these accounts and that would leave us with a pool of possible suspects. Here is a chart of all the people that @horse_js quoted more than 5 times in the past two years.

A lovely report on a fun side project.
