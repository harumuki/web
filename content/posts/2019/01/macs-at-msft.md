Katerina and I were riding an elevator on our way home after spending the day at her co-working space.

“Hey, weren’t you the one wearing a Microsoft hoodie and using a Mac upstairs?“ asked a guy that was on the elevator with us.

“Yeah... I was.” I kind of knew what was coming and looking forward to it.

“Well, is that you know, _allowed_?”

“Sure! At least in some groups. More people than you might expect use Macs at Microsoft. A lot of people in my group have one.“

“But you have to have Windows on it, don’t you?”

“Nope.“ He was confused by that, so I continued. “I do have a Surface laptop which I use for all the things I need Windows for. But I’m in the Azure group, and most of what I do is work with Unix.”

“But,” he said, just not quite processing, “isn’t that kind of weird?”

Yeah, but in a good way. I didn’t have time; otherwise, I would have remembered to mention that some people in my group use straight up Linux, and others even use Chromebooks and have PlayStations hooked up to their televisions.
