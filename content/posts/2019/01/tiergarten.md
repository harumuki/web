The weather in Berlin isn’t typical for January. Instead, it rather feels like permanent November. The temperature has been between freezing and 5ºC, and the skies have been grey. While it’s easy to get around town, it’s my least favorite weather for January. I’d much rather have the bright blue sunny skies that come when the temperature goes below -10ºC.

_(For my American friends, that’s 40ºF and 15ºF.)_
