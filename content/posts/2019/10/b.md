"What's up b"

Every once in a while, when I'm messaging on my iPhone, I randomly end a line with a single 'b' character. Sometimes, I do it a lot. Sometimes, hardly at all. Today, I got a message from a colleague:

"Yeah. Think we can do that b"

Oh. My. God. I'm not alone! You have no idea how happy I am.
