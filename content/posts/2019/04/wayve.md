Cambridge-based Wayve is taking an approach to [autonomous driving that can drive on roads it hasn't seen before](https://wayve.ai/blog/driving-like-human). 

> We donâ€™t tell the car how to drive with hand coded rules: everything is learned from data. This allows us to navigate complex, narrow urban European streets for the first time.

It's fascinating to watch the people working on autonomous driving iterating on their approaches over time. Watching the videos of the [test cars driving through Cambridge](https://youtu.be/26Or4QbLbMM) is also pretty cool.
