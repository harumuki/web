“Daddy, don’t leave again!”

“Trust me kiddo, I don’t want to. I just got back, and I was planning on spending a lot of time with you this week. But, grandpa is sick.”

“No, don’t go!”

“But, it’s _my_ daddy, and he’s really sick, and I need to go see him.”

“I don’t want you to go!”

“I know. I know. But, when I’m older, and I get sick sometime, you’ll come and see me, won’t you?”

“Yeah! When you’re sick I’ll come to see you.”

”Thank you. I love you kiddo.”

“I love you too!”
