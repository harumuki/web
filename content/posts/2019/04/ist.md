Istanbul’s new opened mega-airport is open, and it’s massive. Purposefully massive. The kind of massive that seems to say, “Yes, we built this huge place because we could.” There’s still a lot of work to be done to finish it, but it’s quite the upgrade over the old airport.

Just get ready for a lot of walking if you transit through. It took almost a half hour to get to my gate at the end of one of the concourses from the center of the terminal.
