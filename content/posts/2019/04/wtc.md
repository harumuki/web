My hotel last week in New York was just around the corner from where the twin towers once stood. I didn’t have much spare time during my stay there, but I was able to steal a few minutes the night before I left to go visit the memorial.

I still can’t think quite straight when I’m there. My thoughts are consumed with the discontinuity of what was once there and no longer is with us except in our memories.
