With the completion of our event in New York yesterday, the [Create](https://www.createstartups.io) tour is well and truly underway.

We’ve got 11 more stops planned before the end of June around the world, but it feels really good to get this first one done, to connect with the attendees in New York, and to get their feedback on how we did. We’ll be taking that feedback and rolling it in, adjusting as we go. Iteration is the key, right?

Next stop: tomorrow in [Toronto](https://www.createstartups.io/toronto).
