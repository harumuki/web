title: What are we going to do about this?
---

There's not much that's reasonable to say about the horrific news from Christchurch today. The actions of the gunman, a self-proclaimed fascist, being amplified and repeated by so many others online...

I just can't...

I've been stuck most of the day. Stuck in thoughts that don't go anywhere, at least not anywhere good.

The last few years, the worst side of humanity has been winning in a big way, and while there's nothing new about white supremacy, fascism, violence, or hate, we're seeing how those old human reflexes have adapted to the tools that we've built in and for our online world.

What are we going to do about this?
