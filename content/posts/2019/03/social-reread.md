Worth a re-read is Zeynep Tufecki's article for the MIT Technology Review last August: [How social media took us from Tahir Square to Donald Trump](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611806/how-social-media-took-us-from-tahrir-square-to-donald-trump/).

The conclusion:

> If digital connectivity provided the spark, it ignited because the kindling was already everywhere. The way forward is not to cultivate nostalgia for the old-world information gatekeepers or for the idealism of the Arab Spring. It’s to figure out how our institutions, our checks and balances, and our societal safeguards should function in the 21st century—not just for digital technologies but for politics and the economy in general. This responsibility isn’t on Russia, or solely on Facebook or Google or Twitter. It’s on us.

So, what are we going to do about it?
