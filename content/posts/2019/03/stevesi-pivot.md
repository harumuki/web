Steven Sinofsky's tweet thread about [going through the Microsoft security crisis](https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1106288727758766081) is related to Facebook starting its own pivot, but is useful thinking for taking any kind of organization through a significant shift of strategy:

> All you can do as an organization executing on this sort of pivot is to do the work. Keep people informed. Build incremental trust across all stakeholders by actions.

Nobody knows if Facebook can pull off what Mark Zuckerberg says that he wants to do, but for sure it's going to be messy, take a lot of time, and it will be a hard time for all involved to build up trust.
