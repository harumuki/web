Helping companies through the [Microsoft for Startups](https://startups.microsoft.com/en-us/?WT.mc_id=personal-blog-duncand) program has reinforced my feeling that many problems companies face as they grow are really people problems in disguise.

To help figure out what a startup needs to focus on at each phase of the startup lifecycle, [Wendy van Ierschot gives us a road map](https://medium.com/viepeople/hr-road-to-scale-up-3b9981427d5b):

> We’ve identified five stages, each pegged to a certain number of employees. For each stage, we’ve established which areas an organisation should put its HR focus on.

The diagram in the article showing what to focus on at each stage feels about right, and it’s a better starting point to implementing HR strategy in a startup than having nothing at all.
