I gave into the .dev domain madness and registered [duncan.dev](https://duncan.dev) for my primary website domain. I'll move things over the next few days, hopefully not breaking too much along the way.

I'm such a geek. It _really_ didn't help that our group's internal Slack was talking about _nothing_ but .dev domains. There was just way too much encouragement there from folks like [@bketelson](https://twitter.com/bketelsen) and [@film_girl](https://twitter.com/film_girl). Really, it's a miracle I didn't buy more than one domain.
