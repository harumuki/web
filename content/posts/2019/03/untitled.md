Not everyone likes untitled blog posts. [Dan Steinberg argues](https://dimsumthinking.com/Blog/2019/01/05-Untitled.html):

> As a reader, I remember a post I liked from an author I admire and I look back through their posts and I see a sea of posts without a title. It makes it hard for me to find the one that resonated with me.

Titles _are_ a straightforward affordance for scanning through posts in an archive page. And, it's not just a human reader that might appreciate the hierarchy a title gives. Search engines really lean on them as well, both for indexing and for displaying search results.

Going title-optional in a meaningful way means thinking about both of these issues.
