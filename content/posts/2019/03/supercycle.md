Apple could probably start a massive cycle of MacBook Pro sales by building their Magic Keyboard into the next version. Done.

I'd buy one myself in a heartbeat. The Magic Keyboard is one of my all-time favorites at this point. So much so that I'm considering getting a [Studio Neat Canopy](https://www.studioneat.com/products/canopy) so that I can use one with my iPad.

Yes, I know of a few people who prefer or have adapted to the current generation of MacBook keyboards. But, count up the number of people who are holding onto an older laptop and add them to the number of people who have complained vocally about the current generation.

Draw your own conclusions.
