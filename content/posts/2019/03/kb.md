For International Womenâ€™s Day, I want to highlight [Katerina](https://biliouri.com/about-me)'s work as a speaker coach and speechwriter. The event she just helped curate in South Africa had six speakers, and all six of them got standing ovations during their presentations. She takes particular pleasure in helping other women tell their stories, such as [Keavy McMinn telling her story about identity](https://vimeo.com/187481686), [Katrina Owen talk about mentorship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETIf2GDrWMA) and [Melissa Fleming telling the story of two Syrian refugees](https://www.ted.com/talks/melissa_fleming_a_boat_carrying_500_refugees_sunk_at_sea_the_story_of_two_survivors).

Katerina, you're kicking ass, and I'm proud of you each every day!
