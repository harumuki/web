In an op-ed published in major European newspapers, [Emmanuel Marcon argues for a renewal of the European project](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/04/europe-brexit-uk) in the face of challenges from nationalism and Brexit.

> Never since the second world war has Europe been so essential. Yet never has Europe been in such danger. Brexit stands as the symbol of that. It symbolises the crisis of a Europe that has failed to respond to its peoplesâ€™ need for protection from the major shocks of the modern world.

With Brexit due this month and the European elections in May, this seems to be make or break time for Europe as we know it. I hope that Marcon's arguments help steer the discussion in the right direction.
