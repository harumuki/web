It was a fast intense travel week last week. 13,319 flight miles in 6 days. Two events on two continents. I powered through it by focusing just on what needed to be accomplished, making sure to see and enjoy some the beauty in my surroundings, and by getting as much sleep as possible.

My inbox is a disaster as a result. Oh well.
