## Infrastructure as Code

Iâ€™ve started to capture the infrastructure setup that runs this site on Azure as a set of Azure Resource Manager template files. So far, the DNS records are there. To push changes, I use the following:

```
az deployment group create -c -g domains --template-file azure/domains.json --mode Complete
```
